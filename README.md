Litcoin
--------------

An experimental private and decentralized cryptocurrency built for college students by college students. Pay anonymously.

Why Litcoin?
-----------------

**Private:** Your transactional data such as who is involved in transactions and how much value is sent is shielded from prying eyes. Litcoin utilizes the same privacy technology as Z-Cash called zk-snarks. This zero knowledge technology means that you can transact with trust without sacrificing your privacy. 

**Secure:** Litcoin is a decentralized peer to peer network allowing for transactions without a middle man. Transactions are recording on public ledger and verified through Proof of Work.

**Mission:** We introduce, teach and engage college students about the blockchain. We try to engage not only computer scientists, but students of all kinds to help bring them into understand blockchain technology and the value it can unlock.

**Opportunities:** College students with various majors can come together across universities to get real world experience with blockchain technology.

**Quick Remittance:** Pay and get paid faster than Bitcoin while also being anonymous. Paying college tuition from around the world just got a whole lot easier. 

**Usability:** We prioritize usability and understanding. Our goal is to create simple web and mobile apps that are usable for college students with global availability to accelerate platform adoption.
